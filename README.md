## Guidelines

### At a glance

- Maximum word count of 12,000
- Maximum number of figures/tables: 15
- Following format: Abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion

### From the website

> Original Research articles report on primary and unpublished studies. Original Research may also encompass confirming studies and disconfirming results which allow hypothesis elimination, reformulation and/or report on the non-reproducibility of previously published results. Original Research articles are peer-reviewed, have a maximum word count of 12,000 and may contain no more than 15 Figures/Tables. Authors are required to pay a fee (A-type article) to publish an Original Research article. Original Research articles should have the following format: 1) Abstract, 2) Introduction, 3) Materials and Methods, 4) Results, 5) Discussion. 

## Action items

- TODO - Re-title!
- TODO - [methods] include a figure that depicts the avida virtual hardware/genome
- TODO - with validation control data - show no stochastic phenotypes
- TODO - [Van den Bergh et al., 2018] for relevant examples/research wet lab experiments (e.g., cycling environments, hitchhiking, etc)
- TODO - Draft a figure explaining the metrics
- Question: Do we want to shoot for a bigger journal? 
    - can we claim that this is the first empirical study of consequences of adaptive plasticity?
- Future experiment - repeat this sort of experiment with plastic organisms, but keep entire phylogeny to measure rates of relaxed selection.
- TODO - Define fitness landscape concept somewhere
- Comment from matthew: "if this figure is going into the paper one quick mention of how I first interpreted the graphs in that figure, I first thought time was on the x axis and it was alternating between equ up nand down etc"

### Details to move into supplement

- [sensory instructions]: When executed, sensory instructions either push a ``1'' or a ``-1'' to an organism's memory stack depending on whether a given logic task is currently rewarded or punished.
