## Guidelines

### At a glance

- Maximum word count of 12,000
- Maximum number of figures/tables: 15
- Following format: Abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion

### From the website

> Original Research articles report on primary and unpublished studies. Original Research may also encompass confirming studies and disconfirming results which allow hypothesis elimination, reformulation and/or report on the non-reproducibility of previously published results. Original Research articles are peer-reviewed, have a maximum word count of 12,000 and may contain no more than 15 Figures/Tables. Authors are required to pay a fee (A-type article) to publish an Original Research article. Original Research articles should have the following format: 1) Abstract, 2) Introduction, 3) Materials and Methods, 4) Results, 5) Discussion. 

## Action items

- TODO - Re-title!
- TODO - [supplemental material] include a figure that depicts the avida virtual hardware/genome
- TODO - with validation control data - show no stochastic phenotypes
- TODO - [Van den Bergh et al., 2018] for relevant examples/research wet lab experiments (e.g., cycling environments, hitchhiking, etc)
- Question: Do we want to shoot for a bigger journal? 
    - can we claim that this is the first empirical study of consequences of adaptive plasticity?
- Future experiment - repeat this sort of experiment with plastic organisms, but keep entire phylogeny to measure rates of relaxed selection.
- TODO - Define fitness landscape concept somewhere
- [ ] Make metric names consistent across paper!
- [ ] Clean up/update supplemental material
    - [ ] add list of instructions w/descriptions (avida virtual hardware document)
- [ ] Update reference names for supplemental material and data references.
- [ ] Re-run and add STATIC + sensors condition to supplemental material
- [ ] Clean up genotype/organism language
- [ ] Novel task count => novel task discovery?
- [ ] Strip genotypic fidelity & phenotypic fidelity from paper, replace with mutational stability
- [ ] Analysis: for every change along the lineage, see if it appears in the first half or the second half of an environmental condition (first 50 updates, second 50 updates)

### Details to move into supplement

- [sensory instructions]: When executed, sensory instructions either push a ``1'' or a ``-1'' to an organism's memory stack depending on whether a given logic task is currently rewarded or punished.
