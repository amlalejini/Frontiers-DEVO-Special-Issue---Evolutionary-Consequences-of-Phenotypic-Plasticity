This book solves key problems that have impeded a definitive synthesis in the past. It uses new concepts and specific examples to show how to relate environmentally sensitive development to the genetic theory of adaptive evolution and to explain major patterns of change. In this book development includes not only embryology and the ontogeny of morphology, sometimes portrayed inadequately as governed by'regulatory genes,'but also behavioral development and physiological adaptation, where plasticity is mediated by genetically complex mechanisms like hormones and learning. The book shows how the universal qualities of pheno},

              Escherichia coli
              to accumulate variation in populations of yellow fluorescent proteins and then evolved these proteins toward the new phenotype of green fluorescence. Populations with cryptic variation evolved adaptive genotypes with greater diversity and higher fitness than populations without cryptic variation, which converged on similar genotypes. Populations with cryptic variation accumulated neutral or deleterious mutations that break the constraints on the order in which adaptive mutations arise. In doing so, cryptic variation opens paths to adaptive genotypes, creates historical contingency, and reduces the predictability of evolution by allowing different replicate populations to climb different adaptive peaks and explore otherwise-inaccessible regions of an adaptive landscape.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            In experimental evolution, laboratory-controlled conditions select for the adaptation of species, which can be monitored in real time. Despite the current popularity of such experiments, nature's most pervasive biological force was long believed to be observable only on time scales that transcend a researcher's life-span, and studying evolution by natural selection was therefore carried out solely by comparative means. Eventually, microorganisms' propensity for fast evolutionary changes proved us wrong, displaying strong evolutionary adaptations over a limited time, nowadays massively exploited in laboratory evolution experiments. Here, we formulate a guide to experimental evolution with microorganisms, explaining experimental design and discussing evolutionary dynamics and outcomes and how it is used to assess ecoevolutionary theories, improve industrially important traits, and untangle complex phenotypes. Specifically, we give a comprehensive overview of the setups used in experimental evolution. Additionally, we address population dynamics and genetic or phenotypic diversity during evolution experiments and expand upon contributing factors, such as epistasis and the consequences of (a)sexual reproduction. Dynamics and outcomes of evolution are most profoundly affected by the spatiotemporal nature of the selective environment, where changing environments might lead to generalists and structured environments could foster diversity, aided by, for example, clonal interference and negative frequency-dependent selection. We conclude with future perspectives, with an emphasis on possibilities offered by fast-paced technological progress. This work is meant to serve as an introduction to those new to the field of experimental evolution, as a guide to the budding experimentalist, and as a reference work to the seasoned expert.},

We propose a suite of diagnostic analysis techniques that operate on lineages and phylogenies in digital evolution experiments, with the aim of improving our capacity to quantitatively explore the nuances of evolutionary histories in digital evolution experiments. We present three types of lineage measurements: lineage length, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility. Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, phylogenetic regularity, and depth of the most-recent common ancestor. In addition to quantitative metrics, we also discuss several existing data visualizations that are useful for understanding lineages and phylogenies: state sequence visualizations, fitness landscape overlays, phylogenetic trees, and Muller plots. We examine the behavior of these metrics (with the aid of data visualizations) in two well-studied computational contexts: (1) a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, and (2) a set of qualitatively different environments in the Avida digital evolution platform. These results confirm our intuition about how these metrics respond to various evolutionary conditions and indicate their broad value.},

In asexual populations, the identification of beneficial alleles is confounded by the presence of genetically linked hitchhiker mutations. Parallel evolution experiments enable the recognition of common targets of selection; yet these targets are inherently enriched for genes of large target size and mutations of large effect. A comprehensive study of individual mutations is necessary to create a realistic picture of the evolutionarily significant spectrum of beneficial mutations. Here we use a bulk-segregant approach to identify the beneficial mutations across 11 lineages of experimentally evolved yeast populations. We report that nearly 80\% of detected mutations have no discernible effects on fitness and less than 1\% are deleterious. We determine the distribution of driver and hitchhiker mutations in 31 mutational cohorts, groups of mutations that arise synchronously from low frequency and track tightly with one another. Surprisingly, we find that one-third of cohorts lack identifiable driver mutations. In addition, we identify intracohort synergistic epistasis between alleles of
              hsl7
              and
              kel1

	abstract = {The environmental conditions of microorganisms’ habitats may fluctuate in unpredictable ways, such as changes in temperature, carbon source, pH, and salinity to name a few. Environmental heterogeneity presents a challenge to microorganisms, as they have to adapt not only to be fit under a specific condition, but they must also be robust across many conditions
              and be able to deal with the switch between conditions itself
              . While experimental evolution has been used to gain insight into the adaptive process, this has largely been in either unvarying or consistently varying conditions. In cases where changing environments have been investigated, relatively little is known about how such environments influence the dynamics of the adaptive process itself, as well as the genetic and phenotypic outcomes. We designed a systematic series of evolution experiments where we used two growth conditions that have differing timescales of adaptation and varied the rate of switching between them. We used lineage tracking to follow adaptation, and whole genome sequenced adaptive clones from each of the experiments. We find that both the switch rate and the order of the conditions influences adaptation. We also find different adaptive outcomes, at both the genetic and phenotypic levels, even when populations spent the same amount of total time in the two different conditions, but the order and/or switch rate differed. Thus, in a variable environment adaptation depends not only on the nature of the conditions and phenotypes under selection, but also on the complexity of the manner in which those conditions are combined to result in a given dynamic environment.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Pleiotropic fitness trade-offs and their opposite, buttressing pleiotropy, underlie many important phenomena in ecology and evolution. Yet, predicting whether a population adapting to one ("home") environment will concomitantly gain or lose fitness in another ("non-home") environment remains challenging, especially when adaptive mutations have diverse pleiotropic effects. Here, we address this problem using the concept of the joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE), a local measurable property of the fitness landscape. We derive simple statistics of the JDFE that predict the expected slope, variance and covariance of non-home fitness trajectories. We estimate these statistics from published data from the \textit{Escherichia coli} knock-out collection in the presence of antibiotics. We find that, for some drug pairs, the average trend towards collateral sensitivity may be masked by large uncertainty, even in the absence of epistasis. We provide simple theoretically grounded guidelines for designing robust sequential drug protocols.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
