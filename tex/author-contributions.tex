% The Author Contributions section is mandatory for all articles, including articles by sole authors. If an appropriate statement is not provided on submission, a standard one will be inserted during the production process. The Author Contributions statement must describe the contributions of individual authors referred to by their initials and, in doing so, all authors agree to be accountable for the content of the work. Please see  \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#AuthorandContributors}{here} for full authorship criteria.
