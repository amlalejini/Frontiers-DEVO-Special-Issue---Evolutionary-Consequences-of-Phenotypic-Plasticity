    \textbf{Deleterious instruction accumulation.}
    Raincloud plots of 
    (a) poisonous task acquisition,
    (b) poisonous task acquisition frequency,
    and (c) the proportion of mutations that increase poisonous task performance along a lineage that co-occur with a change in phenotypic profile.
    Each plot is annotated with statistically significant comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests).
    Note that adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolved in \deleteriousHitchhikingPlasticReps\ of \deleteriousHitchhikingReplicates\ replicates from the PLASTIC treatment during phase one of Experiment III; we used this more limited group to seed the \deleteriousHitchhikingPlasticReps\ phase-two PLASTIC replicates.
