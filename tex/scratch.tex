% Background
% -- Questions from papers --
% - Long standing question => does plasticity observed within generations influence subsequent evolutionary change across generations?
% - Phenotypic plasticity slows the rate of evolutionary change because most of the phenotypic variance is environmentally induced and non-heritable.
% - Does plasticity create novel opportunities for selection or does it buffer environmental variation and dampen selection?
% - Phenotypic plasticity can stabilize a population against environmental changes?
% - Hypotheses about phenotypic plasticity
% - Challenging to test because X, Y, Z
% -- Points from papers --
% - Phenotypic plasticity is thought to influence species extinction risk: either by buffering a population against environmental changes, allowing individuals to survive outside of normal range of environmental conditions.
% % how populations and species respond to environmental changes is critical to persistence both now and in future
% - Alternatively, environmental changes that affect reliability environmental cues that influence/adjust/trigger plasticity may put species at risk/susceptibility to extinction. 
% - Plasticity may sometimes promote and may sometimes constrain adaptive evolution.
% %  - promote: plasticity might allow for the colonization of, and persistence in, extreme environments; create novel opportunities for selection
% %  - constrain: plasticity shields genotype from selection thereby slowing adaptive genetic change
% - Plasticity might slow the rate of evolutionary change because most phenotypic variance is environmentally induced and non-heritable [citations].
% - Plasticity source of cryptic variation that may be selected on and eventually canalized, driving adaptive evolution.
% - Understanding the evolutionary consequences of phenotypic plasticity is particularly important in the context of [rapid progression of global climate change] [citations]. 
% % - plasticity modulates how environmental variation influences population dynamics [reed et al., 2010]
% - However, experimentally test hypotheses/experimentally address questions difficult in natural systems because manipulating organisms' capacity for phenotypic plasticity can be impractical and is not always possible.

%%%%%%% Experimental design

% independent replicates of evolving 
% We control the capacity for adaptive phenotypic plasticity to evolve by enabling or disabling organisms' sensory mechanisms. 
% The acclimation phase affords populations time to adapt to a common fluctuating environment.

% The evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity is not a prescribed outcome during the acclimation stage of the experiment (even when the requisite conditions are met [cite]); 

% @AML: this alternative lead-in paragraph describes overall experimental setup, but I'm thinking that this might be better off in the first experiment's description => allows me to be slightly more concrete/specific throughout.
% We conducted a series of experiments using Avida to investigate how the evolution of adaptive plasticity alters evolutionary dynamics and influences evolutionary outcomes in fluctuating environments.
% Each experiment is divided into two phases: an `acclimation' phase and a `measurement' phase.
% During the acclimation phase, we subject evolving populations of digital organisms to a fluctuating environment (cycling between ENV-A and ENV-B); each independent population is seeded with a common ancestor capable only of self-replication. 
% The acclimation phase affords each population time to adapt to their environment; this phase gives adaptive plasticity the opportunity to evolve in experimental treatments with the requisite conditions. 
% During the [second] phase of each experiment, we transfer the most numerous genotype (i.e., the dominant genotype) from each replicate to seed new populations.
% We compare across treatments only during this [second] experiment phase.
% The evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity is not a prescribed outcome during the acclimation phase for conditions in which plasticity is expected to evolve [cite]. 
% [as such, for conditions with the purpose of representing the dynamics of plastic populations, we only continue to the second phase if plasticity evolves].

% Avida is an open-source software platform that provides an instance of evolution \textit{in silico}, allowing researchers to test hypotheses that would be difficult or impossible to address in natural systems.

% The expression of an organism's genome in the context of its virtual hardware and environment [is recorded as its phenotype].
% Avida measures an organism's phenotype by tracking its interactions with its environment.
% Avida tracks each organism as it expresses its genome, measuring an organism's phenotype 
% An organism's phenotype results from the expression of its genome in the context of its virtual hardware and environment.
%The [programming/genetic/?] language that specifies/encodes/constitutes genomes in Avida is Turing Complete (i.e., is able to represent any computable function) and syntactically robust (i.e., any ordering of instructions is syntactically valid, though not necessarily meaningful).

% The genomes are made up of instructions from a computationally universal genetic language (i.e., able to represent any computable function).
% This genetic language is also syntactically robust; that is, any ordering of instructions is syntactically valid, though not necessarily meaningful.
% The instruction set used to specify genomes in Avida is Turing Complete (i.e., is able to represent any computable function) and syntactically robust (i.e., any ordering of instructions is syntactically valid, though not necessarily meaningful).


% Thus, we limit our second phase [comparisons] to

% We compare the evolutionary dynamics of evolving populations during the [second] phase of the experiment.
% This ensures that we limit our observations to populations that are well-adapted to their experimental treatment.
% Because we only continue to the [second] phase in the plasticity-enabled condition if adaptive plasticity evolves, we limit our second phase measurements to phenotypically plastic populations.  

The environment cycles between equal-length periods of ENV-A and ENV-B (as described in Section \ref{sec:methods:evolution-of-plasticity-in-avida}).
% Each of these periods persist for 100 updates; thus, populations experience a total of 1,000 full cycles of ENV-A and 1,000 full cycles of ENV-B during the acclimation phase.
% Each independent population (regardless of experimental treatment) is seeded with a common ancestor capable only of self-replication.
% The acclimation phase gives populations time to adapt to their treatment conditions, affording adaptive plasticity the opportunity to evolve \textit{de novo} in treatments with the requisite conditions; we never seed the acclimation phase with phenotypically plastic genotypes.
% At the end of the acclimation phase, we extract the dominant (i.e., most numerous) genotype from each replicate population to seed a new population for the [second, ``X'',] phase our experiment.
% % to seed a new population 
% The evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity is not a prescribed outcome in treatments intended to produce plastic populations; for such experimental treatments, we only continue to the [second] phase if the dominant genotype [correctly regulates which tasks it performs in ENV-A and ENV-B.]

% % TODO - work in more direct statement about plastic v non-plastic?
% The [second] phase proceeds identically to the first. %; except, we seed populations with a digital organism that is well-adapted to the particular treatment conditions (as opposed to the initial common ancestor).
% During the [second] phase, we track the full evolutionary histories of evolving populations: 
% we maintain the full phylogenies (i.e., [short definition]) of extant populations, including genomes, phenotypic information (e.g., [examples of things we track]), and mutations for post-hoc analysis.
% % @AML: feel like we need one more sentence here to give closure to the overall experimental design?

% We evolve \evolutionaryChangeRateReplicates\ independent replicate populations under each of three experimental conditions:
% (1) a plasticity-enabled treatment where digital organisms can differentiate between ENV-A and ENV-B using sensory instructions (adaptive plasticity can evolve),
% (2) a non-plastic treatment where sensory instructions are disabled (i.e., behave as no-operation instructions),
% and (3) a static control where the environment does not fluctuate.
% We compare the evolutionary dynamics of evolving populations during the [second] phase of the experiment.
% This ensures that we limit our observations to populations that are well-adapted to their experimental treatment.
% Because we only continue to the [second] phase in the plasticity-enabled condition if adaptive plasticity evolves, we limit our second phase measurements to phenotypically plastic populations.  



% Specifically, we compare the phenotypic volatility and mutation accumulation along successful lineages as well as the number of coalescence events that occur in plastic and non-plastic populations evolving in fluctuating environments.
% These measurements are described in further detail in Section [blah].





% @AML: why do we compare?

% We conducted a two-phase experiment to test whether adaptive phenotypic plasticity can dampen the rate of evolutionary change in fluctuating environments.

\subsection{Measuring evolutionary change}
\label{sec:methods:measuring_evoluationray_change}

In this work, we measure rates of evolutionary change in evolving populations using lineage metrics (as described by Dolson et al. in [cite] and [cite]) and by tracking coalescence events. 
A complete lineage describes a continuous line of descent, specifying an unbroken chain of parent-offspring relationships.
For this work, we analyze the lineages of dominant (i.e., the most numerous) genotypes at the end of an experiment's [observation] phase; these lineages are bookended by an extant genotype and the original ancestral genotype used seed the population at the beginning of the observation phase. 

% @AML: can we better/more explicitly tie in how these represent evolutionary change (idk, maybe it's obvious)?
We focus on two lineage metrics: mutation accumulation and phenotypic volatility.
Mutation accumulation measures the total number of mutational changes along a lineage.
For example, we might trivially expect [populations evolving/lineages evolved] under high mutation rates to exhibit high mutation accumulation [cite - tape of life].
We measure phenotypic volatility as the sum of phenotypic changes (from parent to offspring) observed along a lineage [cite].
We might expect elevated levels of both phenotypic volatility and mutation accumulation in populations evolving in a continuously changing environment where they must continuously adapt via \textit{de novo} genetic changes [cite - tape of life].

% coalescence events
% @AML: i feel like this paragraph is missing a little something
In asexual populations without ecological interactions fostering coexistence, phylogenies should coalesce periodically (i.e., the most recent common ancestor shared by the extant population should change).
The rate at which these coalescence events occur is driven by the strength of selection; populations under strong selection pressure should experience more rapid coalescence events than populations under weaker selection [cite?].
For our experiments, we track the rate of coalescence events: how often the most recent common ancestor for each evolving population changes.



[Deleterous hit deleterious alleles/genes ``hitchhike'' to high frequencies within a population along with a beneficial allele/gene].
We repeated the experiment described in Section \ref{sec:methods:experiment-evolutionary-dynamics}; however, during the [second] phase of evolution, we introduced a purely deleterious instruction, \code{inst-poison}, that can mutate into offspring genomes.
When executed, \code{inst-poison} reduces an organism's reproductive success by decreasing its metabolic rate by [\instPoisonMagnitude].
Because executing \code{inst-poison} is always deleterious, we expect it to increase in prevalence primarily due to hitchhiking effects.
At the end of the experiment, we compare the number of \code{inst-poison} instructions executed by the final dominant genotypes across treatments.
Additionally, we analyze the prevalence of these deleterious instructions along the lineages of these genotypes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% old %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We found no significant difference in the number of elapsed generations in populations across experimental conditions [stats/supplement].

Figure [X] gives the number of coalescence events, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility for PLASTIC, NON-PLASTIC, and STATIC experimental treatments.
Across each of these metrics, we found that NON-PLASTIC populations experienced more evolutionary change than PLASTIC and STATIC populations.
We found that NON-PLASTIC populations underwent significantly more coalescence events than both PLASTIC and STATIC populations [stats], and NON-PLASTIC lineages had significantly higher mutation accumulation and phenotypic volatility than PLASTIC and STATIC lineages [stats].

The differences in mutation accumulation across conditions also manifest in the observed length of dominant genotypes; we observed significantly longer genomes in dominant organisms from NON-PLASTIC populations than in PLASTIC or STATIC populations [stats].
% very clunky sentence that might actually belong in discussion
We hypothesize that both the larger mutation accumulation and the larger genomes in NON-PLASTIC populations is primarily a result of neutral or mildly deleterious mutations hitchhiking to fixation along with beneficial mutations that genetically activate or deactivate a logic task [to better align with current environmental conditions].
% [if we include the above sentence, need a sentence or two about coalescence events and phenotypic volatility]


We observed that the evolutionary dynamics of plastic populations evolving in a fluctuating environment are more similar to that of non-plastic populations evolving in a constant environment than to non-plastic populations evolving in fluctuating environment.
We found no significant difference in number of coalescence events or in mutation accumulation across PLASTIC and STATIC treatments [stats].
% [mention relaxed selection?]
We did observe significantly higher phenotypic volatility in PLASTIC lineages than in STATIC lineages; this is likely due to the possibility for cryptic variation to accumulate in plastic genomes, which is temporarily hidden to selection (until the environment changes) but revealed in our measure of phenotypic volatility.

The full suite of all possible 77 one-, two-, and three-input logic tasks is a standard environment in Avida [cite]; see our supplemental material for a full list of additional logic tasks [cite].

% GENOME LENGTH RESULTS (braindump state)??
% The differences in mutation accumulation across conditions also manifest in the observed length of dominant genotypes; we observed significantly longer genomes in dominant organisms from NON-PLASTIC populations than in PLASTIC or STATIC populations [stats].
% We hypothesize that both the larger mutation accumulation and the larger genomes in NON-PLASTIC populations is primarily a result of neutral or mildly deleterious mutations hitchhiking to fixation along with beneficial mutations that genetically activate or deactivate a logic task [to better align with current environmental conditions].

% We independently evaluated a range of penalties imposed on organisms each time they executed a \code{poison} instruction: no penalty, a small penalty (3\% metabolic rate reduction), an intermediate penalty (10\% metabolic rate reduction), and a large penalty (30\% metabolic rate reduction).
% Without a metabolic rate penalty, executing \code{poison} is neutral; each other version of the \code{poison} instruction is explicitly deleterious.


% We experimentally manipulated the capacity for adaptive phenotypic plasticity in order to directly test how adaptive plasticity shifts evolutionary dynamics in a simple cyclic environment relative to non-plastic populations evolving under otherwise identical conditions. 

% In asexual populations without horizontal gene transfer, all mutations are linked.
% As such, neutral or deleterious mutations that co-occur with a beneficial mutation can sometimes `hitchhike' to fixation [cite - Van den Bergh 2018].
% Without co-occurrence, natural selection normally prevents deleterious mutations from reaching high frequencies, while genetic drift will allow some neutral mutations to eventually fix [citations]. 
% However, hitchhiking effects have been shown to drive both neutral [citations] and deleterious mutations to high frequencies [citations].

% Further, under the conventional perspective of adaptive evolution that focuses 
% selection that acts on non- heritable phenotypic variation in a population is often regarded as selection that does not produce an evolu- tionary response [ghalambor et al 2007]

% [Plasticity has been hypothesized to constrain evolutionary change because most of the phenotypic variation that results from plastic responses is environmentally induced and thus non-heritable, shielding other traits from selection \citep{gupta_study_1982,ancel_undermining_2000,huey_behavioral_2003,price_role_2003,paenke_influence_2007}.] % [citations]
% [Take more time/care with the plasticity constrains evolution perspective here].

% Why might plasticity slow evolution?
% - buffers population against environmental changes => individuals can rely on environmentally-induced phenotypic changes than evolving new traits. 

% Given genetic variation in the tendency to produce such variants, selection can refine these traits through genetic changes over time (i.e., genetic accommodation); further, if novel conditions persist, selection may drive plastic phenotypes to lose their environmental dependence over time in a process known as genetic assimilation \citep{west-eberhard_developmental_2005,pigliucci_phenotypic_2006,crispo_baldwin_2007,schlichting_phenotypic_2014,levis_evaluating_2016}. 
% Plastic rescue 

% These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive; the circumstances under which plasticity promotes or constrains further evolution will depend on many factors, such as [form of plasticity, genetic background, ...] \cite{ghalambor_non-adaptive_2015}.
% Understanding the contexts under which plasticity promotes or constrains further evolution is important if we are to predict and limit the damage caused by the acceleration of environmental shifts due to global climate change [citations].

% Our experiments build on previous digital evolution studies on the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity \citep{clune_investigating_2007,lalejini_evolutionary_2016} and on the evolutionary consequences of fluctuating environments \citep{li_digital_2004,canino-koning_fluctuating_2019}.

%%%%%%%%%% discussion %%%%%%%%%%%%%
% As such, adaptive plasticity is often thought to constrain evolutionary responses because phenotypic variation in a plastic trait is likely to be environmentally-induced, shielding the genotype from selection [citations; Ghalambor 2007, etc]. % @AML: TODO - find papers that explicitly propose/argue/test this.

% -- Abstract --
% O: Here, we investigate how phenotypic plasticity alters evolutionary dynamics and influences evolutionary outcomes in fluctuating environments.
% NG: Here, we use self-replicating computer programs called ``Avidians'' to investigate how phenotypic plasticity alters evolutionary dynamics and influences evolutionary outcomes when these digital organisms are evolved in cyclically changing environments. Specifically, we evaluate the potential of plastic and non-plastic populations of Avidians to evolve and then maintain complex traits.

% Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity for a single genotype to alter phenotypic expression in response to environmental conditions, allowing plastic genotypes to dynamically adjust to environmental change.

%We compare the evolutionary dynamics of plastic and non-plastic populations of digital organisms --- self-replicating computer programs --- evolved under cyclically changing environments; we evaluate each population's potential to evolve and maintain additional complex features.

% These non-plastic populations undergo more frequent selective sweeps, accumulate many more genetic changes, and move to regions of the fitness landscape where mutations will more frequently result in phenotypic changes. 

% ------- Methods --------

We conducted our study using the Avida Digital Evolution Platform \citep{ofria_avida:_2009}. 
Avida provides a computational study system where populations of digital organisms undergo Darwinian evolution, allowing researchers to test hypotheses that would be difficult or impossible to address in natural systems.
Avida is a well-established open-source digital evolution software platform that has been used to conduct a wide range of well-regarded studies on evolutionary dynamics, including 
the origins of complex features \citep{lenski_evolutionary_2003},
the survival of the flattest effect \citep{wilke_evolution_2001},
and the origins of reproductive division of labor \citep{goldsby_evolutionary_2014}.
% - Coevolution + complex features, ...
For this work, we used a modified version of Avida that is freely available on GitHub [cite].

% Overview of digital organisms in avida
Digital organisms in Avida are self-replicating computer programs that compete for space on a finite toroidal grid.
Each digital organism is defined by a linear sequence of program instructions (its genome) and a set of virtual hardware components used to interpret and express those instructions.
Avida tracks each organism as it expresses its genome in a given environment in order to measure that organism's phenotype.
These genomes are built using a genetic language that is both robust and expressive; however, genomes are not guaranteed to encode meaningful information or to do so efficiently.
The genetic language includes operations for basic computations, flow control (e.g., conditional logic and looping), input, output, and self-replication.
The virtual hardware set includes components such as a central processing unit (CPU) for executing instructions, registers to store values, buffers for inputs and outputs, and memory stacks.

% Reproduction & mutation
Organisms in Avida reproduce asexually by copying their genome instruction-by-instruction and then dividing. 
However, these operations can be configured to be erroneous, potentially resulting in mutated offspring.
Erroneous copy operations result in a single-instruction substitution mutation; in this work, copy operations err at a per-instruction rate of 0.0025 (i.e., one mutation expected for every 400 instructions copied).
% ----- For variable-length genome experiments (shifted to all fixed-length) ----
% Next, divide operations will erroneously insert a random instruction into the offspring's genome at a per-division rate of 0.05 (i.e., one insertion is expected every 20 replication events).
% Likewise, divide operations will delete a random instruction from the offspring's genome also at a per-division rate of 0.05.
For all experiments described in this paper, we held individual genomes at a fixed length of 100 instructions (i.e., we did not include insertion and deletion mutations).
When an organism divides, its offspring is placed in a random location in the population, replacing any previous occupant.
We limited the population size to 3600 organisms; thus, there is a competition for space in Avida, and as such, improvements to the speed of self-replication are advantageous.
The combination of this competition for space and heritable variation from imperfect replication results in evolution by natural selection.

% Fitness/metabolic rate/improving replication speed
During evolution, organism replication rates improve in two ways: by improving genome efficiency (e.g., using a more compact encoding) or by accelerating the rate at which the genome is expressed (their ``metabolic rate'').
An organism's metabolic rate determines the speed at which it executes instructions in its genome.
Initially, an organism's metabolic rate is proportional to the length of its genome, but that rate is adjusted as it completes designated tasks, such as performing Boolean logic computations \citep{ofria_avida:_2009}.
In this way, we can reward or punish particular phenotypic traits.

% Next, divide operations will erroneously insert a random instruction into the offspring's genome at a per-division rate of 0.05 (i.e., one insertion is expected every 20 replication events).
% Likewise, divide operations will delete a random instruction from the offspring's genome also at a per-division rate of 0.05.

% Phenotypic plasticity can serve as a source of heritable cryptic variation (i.e., unexpressed traits that vary in a population, but do not currently affect fitness).
% Such ``hidden'' genetic variation is created as mutations that are shielded from selection (due to inexpression) accumulate in genes associated with the plastic response upon which selection can act when the environment changes \citep{schlichting_hidden_2008,levis_evaluating_2016}.  
% Mutations that are shielded from selection (due to inexpression) can accumulate in genes associated with the plastic response; selection can then act on this  ``hidden'' genetic variation when the environment changes \citep{schlichting_hidden_2008,levis_evaluating_2016}.  

% This ``hidden'' genetic variation can accumulates in a plastic trait's response to a novel or infrequently experienced environmental cue, creating opportunities for selection when environmental conditions change to reveal this hidden variation .
