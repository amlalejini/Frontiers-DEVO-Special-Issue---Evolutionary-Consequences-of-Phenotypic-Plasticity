    \textbf{Novel task evolution.}
    Raincloud plots of
    (a) final novel task count,
    (b) novel task discovery,
    and (c) novel task loss.
    See Table \ref{tab:metrics-definitions} for descriptions of each metric.
    Each plot is annotated with statistically significant comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests).
    Note that adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolved in \novelTraitsPlasticReps\ of \novelTraitsReplicates\ replicates from the PLASTIC treatment during phase one of this experiment; we used this more limited group to seed the resulting \novelTraitsPlasticReps\ phase-two PLASTIC replicates.
