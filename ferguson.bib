	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Pleiotropic fitness trade-offs and their opposite, buttressing pleiotropy, underlie many important phenomena in ecology and evolution. Yet, predicting whether a population adapting to one ("home") environment will concomitantly gain or lose fitness in another ("non-home") environment remains challenging, especially when adaptive mutations have diverse pleiotropic effects. Here, we address this problem using the concept of the joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE), a local measurable property of the fitness landscape. We derive simple statistics of the JDFE that predict the expected slope, variance and covariance of non-home fitness trajectories. We estimate these statistics from published data from the \textit{Escherichia coli} knock-out collection in the presence of antibiotics. We find that, for some drug pairs, the average trend towards collateral sensitivity may be masked by large uncertainty, even in the absence of epistasis. We provide simple theoretically grounded guidelines for designing robust sequential drug protocols.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Natural populations often experience the weakening or removal of a source of selection that had been important in the maintenance of one or more traits. Here we refer to these situations as ‘relaxed selection,’ and review recent studies that explore the effects of such changes on traits in their ecological contexts. In a few systems, such as the loss of armor in stickleback, the genetic, developmental and ecological bases of trait evolution are being discovered. These results yield insights into whether and how fast a trait is reduced or lost under relaxed selection. We provide a prospectus and a framework for understanding relaxed selection and trait loss in natural populations. We also examine its implications for applied issues, such as antibiotic resistance and the success of invasive species.},
